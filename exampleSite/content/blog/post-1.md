Deep inside water, you can still survive, with all beauty and grace. Maybe in the outer world, you are poisonous, but that's for your protection.  
  
We all live like this, deep inside we all have different versions of ourselves pure, kind. BUT for survival in the world, we take our bitter mouth as a shield of poison with us.  
  
At starting I always felt what I did to someone that they spoke rudely to me, but as I came across people, tried understanding them, I came to this thinking.  
  
And I believed in the phrase beauty lies in beholders eyes. It's you what you chose, bitter mouth or kind heart.  
  
Because, I totally believe, if got to choose between right and kind, choose kind.✌️
